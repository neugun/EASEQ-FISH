## 3D_SeqFISH analysis toolbox
Table of Contents

**Description**

3D_SeqFISH analysis toolbox is a integrated 3d_SeqFISH analysis method, aiming to provide the general 3D registration and SeqFISH analysis for 3D spatial transcriptome. This tool box is largely based on EASIFISH, MULTIFISH, Bigstream, Point cloud registration methods, and SeqFISH, etc. 

**Installment**

EASIFISH, MULTIFISH, Bigstream, Point cloud registration methods, and SeqFISH

**Modules**

Preprocessing with EASIFISH Pipeline (Stitching,Spot detection,Segmentation and Registration)

Warp Mask and Spot assignment

Classic Point cloud registration (e.g.,Ransac and ICP)

Deep-learning based Point cloud registration (e.g., RPMnet and PCRnet)

Barcoding and decoding analysis

**Example**
Jupyter notebooks and Sample data

_Now, ROI_ransac_napari_fixmovROI.ipynb is the major python scripts for processing the 3d registration of FISH point clouds._

Pipeline executed with Bash command

**Additional information**
Visualization

Post processing
